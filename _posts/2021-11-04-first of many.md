This is my first semester of graduate school has to be the stuffs of legends. I have have felt the highs and the low during the cause of the semester i have learnt new concepts from the from solving linear quadratic nash games to understating complexity theory. I have come to the realization of learning from first principle to feel my knowledge gap for me to apply the new concepts i have learnt.

Some knowledge gaps i need to fill is grasping linear algebra, numerical optimization and calculus and i hope to use the winter break to acquirer this knowledge. Looking back so far at semester i honestly feel insufficiently  knowledgeable about robotics.Over the coming weeks i hope to write more blog posts on concepts i have learned.
