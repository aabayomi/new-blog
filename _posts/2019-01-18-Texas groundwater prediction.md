Texas currently does not have a legislature concerning the use of groundwater. Therefore, I thought about providing a tool that will help monitor the use of groundwater and also give a prediction of groundwater levels under given climatic conditions.

To better understand how the excessive use of groundwater affects groundwater storage, I built a web web-based tool to monitor groundwater resources available on-demand and interactivelyâ€”built using HTML, JavaScript, leaflet.js, and flask.

This project [code](https://github.com/aabayomi/groundwater-project) can be found here.
