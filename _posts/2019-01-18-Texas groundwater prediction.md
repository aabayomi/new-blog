Texas currently do not have a legislature concerning the use of groundwater.I thought about providing a tool that will help monitor the use of groundwater and also providing a prediction of groundwater levels under given climatic conditions.

To better understand how the excessive use of groundwater affects the groundwater storage i built a web  web-based tool to monitor groundwater resources available on demand and interactively.Built using HTML, JavaScript, leaflet.js and flask.

This project [code](https://github.com/aabayomi/groundwater-project) can be found here.
